breaking
========

Just my little attempt at breaking things up. My terminal can get cluttered after awhile so having a quick shortcut to split things up without clearing the screen helps when scrolling back up to find whatever you are looking for. Stick the file somewhere and set an alias to it. Mine looks like `alias hr="sh ~/misc/hr"` and anytime I switch tasks or just want to break up some logs I do `hr` (I'm a front-end guy so hr makes sense). Inspired by [LuRsT/hr](https://github.com/LuRsT/hr).
